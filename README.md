# Predicting Heart Attack Risk Using Machine Learning Techniques

## Project Overview

This repository was created for the DSCI 631 course at Drexel University, Applied Machine Learning. The overall scope of this project was to predict heart attack risk using Machine Learning techniques based off other health- and heart-based parameters.  The heart attack database was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset).

## File Manifest: 

- `HeartAttackPredictor.ipynb` - Main code that predicts heart attack risk using Machine Learning techniques.
- `Folder /data` - Contains all data files 
  - `heart.csv` - Heart Attack data (source in **Project Overview**)
- `Folder /documents` - Contains all miscellaneous documents
  - `Project Proposal.docx` - Project proposal word document, required for class
- `Folder /.ipynb_checkpoints` - Contains checkpoint saves of `HeartAttackPredictor.ipynb`.
## Reason for Project:
There are several factors that doctors must consider quickly when assessing a patient's risk for heart attack.  These include: age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol and more.  Creating a machine learning algorithm to detect patterns and more accurately predict risk will save lives and save time for doctors to focus on other patients.

## Team Members

Our team consisted of the following individuals: 

- Zach Carlson, zc378@drexel.edu
- Andrew Napolitano, asn65@drexel.edu
- Tyler Bread, tb3245@drexel.edu

## Requirements
- Python â‰¥ 3.8. 
- Python modules, packages, and methods required: 
    - `pandas`
    - `matplotlib.pylot`
    - `numpy`
    - `scipy`
    - `sklearn`

## How to Execute Code: 

All of the code in this project needs to be opened with the Jupyter notebook environment. We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to help with Jupyter notebook.  Additionally, this code can be run in Google Colab or your preferred Python coding environment, assuming folder organization remains unchanged.
